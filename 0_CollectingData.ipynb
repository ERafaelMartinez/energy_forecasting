    "In order to run ALL the following notebooks on a local computer you will need to download the database held in the [Kaggle Competition Web Page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ashrae-energy-prediction/overview), as well as [this](https://www.kaggle.com/vladimirsydor/leakaggregator) other post also in Kaggle which helds some additional data to increase the yearly data. This is only needed if you want to run the data preparation process in notebook number 1. If you only want to work with the already cleaned data, just make sure de document `full_data.csv` is contained in `./data/clean/`. After that you can extract the zipfile using the following function or as you find most convenient."
